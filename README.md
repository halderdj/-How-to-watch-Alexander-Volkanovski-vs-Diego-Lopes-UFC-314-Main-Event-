# -How-to-watch-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-UFC-314-Main-Event-

This is a fight for the vacant UFC featherweight title, which was vacated by former champion Ilia Topuria upon moving to lightweight.
Fight Overview
Alexander Volkanovski: The former F.W. champion (26-4) is challenging as he tries to regain his title, which he lost to Ilia Topuria in February 2024. For Volkanovski, this is following two-straight knockouts, his last two bouts in fact, to Topuria and Islam Makhachev that arguably have put him in a career tailspin. Widely regarded as a phenomenal striker, with elite conditioning and fight IQ, Volkanovski is a dangerous man to face despite some doubts over his durability after recent losses.
Diego Lopes: The Brazilian challenger (26-6) is on a tear and currently riding a five-fight win streak with recent wins over Brian Ortega and Dan Ige. Lopes is a thunderous knockout artist and dangerous grappler, but he’s running into a major jump in competition against Volkanovski. This will be Lopes’ first title fight with the UFC.
Key Factors
Experience and Fight IQ: Volkanovski has tons of championship experience, defending the featherweight strap five times in his reign. His ability to adapt, and control fights, could prove critical against Lopes.
Early Lopes: Lopes is active early and has knock-out power to finish the fight before it gets started. Yet, his cardio has been scrutinized over the longer distance, which could be a hindrance in a five-rounder.
Durability Risking Volkanovski: Two back-to-back knockouts have not left Volkanovski as flexible as he used to be so questions arrives about Volkanovski's chin facing Lopes's power punches.
CARDIO ADVANTAGE: If Volkanovski is able to survive Lopes’ early onslaught, his superior conditioning might allow him to take over in the later rounds.
Betting Odds
Alexander Volkanovski: —125 to —170 (slight favorite)
Diego Lopes: +105 to +115 (dog).
Expert Predictions
